## Hi there

TRaaS (Technological Risk-defense as a Service) is a comprehensive solution for modern Site Reliability Engineering, which prevents and solves all kinds of potential faults and stability risks that arise during the whole software lifetime.

Our main interests lie in the following areas:
* The observability platform that provides various runtime detail of IT infrastructures and businesses.
* Data-driven and intelligent change control system which prevents potential faults.
* Auto-scaling and related facilities, which achieve the optimal balance between stability and resource consumption.
* AIOps infrastructure and its best practice, which aims to improve the efficiency of SREs.
* Large-scale chaos engineering and its best practice.

Our Projects
* Kapacity
* ChaosMeta
* DB-GPT
* CodeFuse
* AlterShiled
* CeresDB CeresDB is a cloud-native time-series database that aims to handle both time-series and analytic workloads efficiently.
* HoloInsight HoloInsight is a cloud-native observability platform with a special focus on real-time log analysis and AI integration.
* Pyraformer Low-complexity Pyramidal Attention for Long-range Time Series Modeling and Forecasting This is the Pytorch implementation of Pyraformer (Pyramidal Attention based Transformer) in the ICLR paper
* SmartUnit
