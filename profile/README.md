## Hi there

TRaaS (Technological Risk-defense as a Service) is a comprehensive solution for modern Site Reliability Engineering, which prevents and solves all kinds of potential faults and stability risks that arise during the whole software lifetime.

Our main interests lie in the following areas:
* The observability platform that provides various runtime detail of IT infrastructures and businesses.
* Data-driven and intelligent change control system which prevents potential faults.
* Auto-scaling and related facilities, which achieve the optimal balance between stability and resource consumption.
* AIOps infrastructure and its best practice, which aims to improve the efficiency of SREs.
* Large-scale chaos engineering and its best practice.
